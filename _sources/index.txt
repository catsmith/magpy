   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Magpy's documentation!
=================================

Magpy is a web application framework based on an asynchronous RESTful NoSQL approach.

Magpy also plays nicely with your favourite web framework. For example, you might have an existing site built Django, Tornado, or Ruby on Rails, etc, but you want to add a fast and powerful REST API and/or some client side HTML5 features.
