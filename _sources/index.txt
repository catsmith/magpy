Welcome to Magpy's documentation!
=================================

Magpy is a web application framework designed to help you write HTML5 rich applications based on a fast asynchronous RESTful NoSQL approach.

Magpy also plays nicely with your favourite web framework. For example, you might have an existing site built Django, Tornado, or Ruby on Rails, etc, but you want to add a fast and powerful REST API and/or some client side HTML5 features.
