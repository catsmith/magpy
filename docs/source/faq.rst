Frequently asked questions
==========================

How do I get a Python shell?
----------------------------

When you want a Python interpreter you type `python` (or `ipython` if you are trendy). You use Magpy python code by simply importing it.

Unlike some other frameworks, say Django for example, there is no automated magic with environment variables, everything is just standard Python.

Where's the settings.py file?
------------------------------

There is not one. The defaults are (hopefully) sensible, all site specific settings are in the database.
